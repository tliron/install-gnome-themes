# Some older operating systems don't have sass, in which case you can manually install:
# sudo apt install ruby ruby-bundler ruby-dev
# gem install --user-install sass

# Note: some operating systems come with the Numix theme pre-installed.
# We will remove it to avoid conflict with our more up-to-date version.
